**1. Does preprocessing affect the result of the model? Why?**
git
All in all, I realized that preprocessing the data is pretty important before feeding it to the K-Means model. I noticed that K-Means mostly works with numbers because it’s trying to figure out how "far apart" things are to group them. So, for the Melbourne housing data, I had to pick out columns that were numerical, like 'Price', 'Landsize', and 'Rooms'. Another thing was the missing values, or NaNs; the model wouldn't know what to do with those when trying to calculate distances, so I filled them in using the average for each column. I understand that doing this changes the data points a bit, so the groups the model finds afterward would probably be different than if I'd just deleted those rows or used a different value. It makes sense that cleaning and choosing the right data first would give more meaningful clusters, and I also learned that if different features have really different scales (like a huge 'Landsize' number versus a small 'Rooms' number), that could also skew the results if they weren't "scaled," though for this beginner approach, we just focused on handling the missing numbers and picking relevant columns.

**2. What is your conclusion based on the interpretation or result of your model?**

After running K-Means with three clusters (k=3) on the Melbourne housing data, I was able to see that the model did group the houses into these three different categories. When I plotted 'Price' against 'Distance from CBD', it seemed like the clusters showed some interesting patterns. For example, it looked like one group might be the more expensive houses that are closer to the city, while another could be the cheaper ones further out, and the third one might be somewhere in between or capture a different mix. However, I understood that this 2D plot is just a small part of the picture because K-Means actually used all seven features I selected (like 'Landsize', 'Rooms', 'Bathroom' count, etc.) to decide on the groups. To really know what defined each cluster, I realized I'd need to look deeper, maybe by calculating the average 'Price', average 'Landsize', and so on for all the houses in each specific cluster. That would give a better story about what makes a house "typical" for Cluster 0, 1, or 2. Also, I just picked k=3 to start with; for a real project, I’d probably want to use something like the elbow method to figure out if there's a more "natural" or optimal number of clusters the data points towards. So, while the model did find groups, I learned that interpreting what those groups really mean and choosing the best settings takes a bit more investigation.
